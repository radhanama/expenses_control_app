# expenses_control_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Dev Container

This repository includes a [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) configuration.
It uses the `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/flutter:stable` image which provides Flutter with
the Android SDK and common desktop dependencies preinstalled. The container also
downloads and installs Android Studio so that all `flutter doctor` checks pass.
After opening the project in a container-aware editor like VS Code, the
environment will run `flutter doctor` automatically to verify your setup.
